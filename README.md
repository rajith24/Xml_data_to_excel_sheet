### Things To Do:
>   * Clone or Download my [github repository](https://github.com/rajith24/Xml_data_to_excel_sheet.git)
>   * Paste your .xml inside the cloned repository.
>   * OPEN [parsing_xml.py](https://github.com/rajith24/Xml_data_to_excel_sheet/blob/master/parsing_xml.py) file.
>   * Edit [parsing_xml.py](https://github.com/rajith24/Xml_data_to_excel_sheet/blob/master/parsing_xml.py) file by changing the name of input .xml file to your .xml file name.
>   * Also change the name of the ecxel file created as your requirement.
